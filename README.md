# Pathfinding

Two ways of computing the shortest total path between two points in a weighted, undirected graph. Dijkstras algorithm and Astar search are both used on the same input. The data being used is meant to represent the United State railroad system. Data found online by instructor Hankins.

To find a path, enter the IDs of the start and goal stations. These can be found in the qc48.ndr file which contains the railstation IDs, longitude and latitude, and station state and name. Direct links between stations can be verified by looking in the qc48.llr file which contains the connecting stations, and the distance and compass direction between them.
